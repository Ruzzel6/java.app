Java application:
a .class file is a file that contains Java bytecode, which is the compiled version of a Java source file (.java). When you write Java code in a .java file, you need to compile it using the Java compiler (javac). This process converts the human-readable Java source code into bytecode that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can understand and execute.
